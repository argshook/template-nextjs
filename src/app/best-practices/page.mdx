# Best practices

Different types of links:
- Navigating with paths: `/folder-name/`
- Navigating with URLs: `https://www.dhub.dev/`

#### Markdown link
For all internal links the easiest way is using markdown syntax.

```mdx
[text link](/pathName)
```

#### Next/Link
When you want to open in a new tab, use the `target="blank"` attribute inside Nextjs `Link` component.

```mdx
<Link href="/folder-name/" target="blank">text link</Link>
```
