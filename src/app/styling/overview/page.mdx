# How to customize the look and feel

The easiest way to add a custom brand to you documentation is to adjust the css variables `src/app/globals.css`.

For example, if you want headings in your text to be blue,
you'd find out that the color of headings uses the `--foreground` css variable,
and override it like this in your `globals.css` file.

```css title="globals.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@import '../../../../packages/ui/src/styles.css';

@layer root {
  .dark {
    --foreground: 200 100% 70%;
  }
}
```

  Should you want even more fine-grained control over the components such as
  `Callout`, `CodeBlock`, `Table` simply override the component you want to
  change in the `src/mdx-components.tsx` file.
